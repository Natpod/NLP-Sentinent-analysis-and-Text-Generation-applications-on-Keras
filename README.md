# NLP-Sentinent-analysis-and-Text-Generation-applications-on-Keras

This repository contains a `NLP_implementations_crashcourse.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook code for several NLP implementations on Keras. Feel free to navigate the code and have fun learning NLP from scratch while you are at it!! 

You could be generating songs like the following with this code:

```swift
my darling you are walking are so high and             
And if you gonna join me i'll be your guide              
Day... after day i go through the motions             
No matter how many miles you walk away from me lorraine in the rain will keep falling you rhymes rhymes    
What you'll decide? some                   
What I lose, what i find without your love you have to ask and i will show rhymes love rhymes    
Forget tomorrow we can do tonight again again again             
Sharing my history                    
For now letâ€™s leave them all behind love you behind              
                    
Do whatchya, whatchya, whatchya want tomorrow we can do tonight again again again again          
```

This repository is training Keras ML models on the following data sources:

* Sentinent analysis for sarcasm detenction in [Kaggle News Headlines dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection)
* Song/Text generation based on [Kaggle Eurovision song lyric dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/sarcasm.json)
